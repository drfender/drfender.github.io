                        Articles given to you in markdown will have tags attached to them called Topic. One (and only one) article will be marked the main 
                        article for a topic.If you click on the card for an article that is the main article of a topic, and the card itself is not the main card on 
                        the page, you go to the topic page. If the card is the main card on the page, you go to the article. If the article is not the main article 
                        in a topic, you go to the article to be a black border at the bottom on desktops. Remember the main page for the "blog", 
                        list of articles is also a topic page. Remember you can have subtopics. Articles may have 0 or 1 main pictures. If the article has 
                        a main picture it should show up in the card. Otherwise the card should only have text. Shape of the card should depend on shape 
                        of the picture. Alternatively, maybe for the beginning come up with some tags that have to be set to determine the shape of the 
                        cad etc and we will set them for each article.

                        Don’t like the white and black diagonal lines on top. I do want it to look like paper but not necessarily typewritten. We are trying to convey old-school but also very high quality, old-school but high quality. As in our website is old-school by choice even though we can clearly make it look like something else. Think a really well printed scientific book, not a typewritten document. That having been said I do like the retro look and this is a fantastic first step. I’m not sure I completely love the buttons. Let’s certainly use more modern font. Also attached is a zip file with logos and favicon for Reboot’s logo.

                        be fairly simple, even trivial to change any of the actual text. We will need to put in a small disclaimer at the bottom of images 
                        that are graphs that show data as well. The language for that disclaimer is:

                        Reboot Advisors LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reboot Investing Inc., is registered as an investment advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission and as a commodity trading advisor with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Reboot Advisors is also a member of the National Futures Association in that capacity.
                        Reboot utilizes algorithms to analyze data and create investment plans unique to each client. As with any strategy or system, there are limitations and assumptions that must be made. While Reboot believes its strategies are based on robust features in the market, Reboot may well be relying on what are in fact ephemeral random artifacts of the data it has analyzed. Further, even when a quantitative investment strategy is based on high quality analysis of historical data, the performance expected will only be realized if the salient features of the market that the model attempts to capture continue. If the market ceases to behave as it has in the past, the strategy may not perform as expected. Note that an extended period of good performance is no guarantee against such risk. A quantitative investment strategy that has performed well for a brief or extended period may perform badly for an extended period and may stop working entirely and start performing badly from then unto eternity.
                        Although Reboot makes every effort to preserve each client’s capital and achieve real growth of wealth, investing in markets involves risk of loss that each client should be prepared to bear. All investment programs have certain risks that are borne by the investor. While Reboot’s investment approach constantly keeps the risk of loss in mind, there are no guarantees in the markets.
                        Notwithstanding the method of analysis or investment strategy employed by the Firm, the assets within a client’s portfolio are subject to risk of devaluation or loss. Reboot wants clients to be aware that there are many different events that can affect the value of assets or a portfolio, including but not limited to, changes in financial status of companies, market fluctuations, changes in exchange rates, trading suspensions and delays, technological changes, economic reports, and natural disasters. Please refer to Reboot’s ADV Part 2A for more detailed description of the risks inherent in investing in the markets
